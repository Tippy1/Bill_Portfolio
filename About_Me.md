# About Me
***

I am currently immersed in the Swift Coding and App Development Certificate program at The Ohio State University. Exploring the intricacies of Swift and delving into the world of app development has been an incredibly enriching experience. The training at OSU has provided me with a solid foundation in coding and app creation. I am thoroughly enjoying every aspect of the class, from problem-solving challenges to the creative process of bringing an idea to life through coding. This journey has not only expanded my technical skills but has also ignited a passion for innovation in the digital realm.
